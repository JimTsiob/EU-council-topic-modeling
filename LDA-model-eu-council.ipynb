To: intl-mkt@rafael.co.il Cc: To whom it may concern at the military complex of Rafael. I am writing you with full transparency within my writings and including some attachments which are to back up the basis of some of this electronic letter, please give this writing a chance to be read. In due time you will understand why I'm asking for you to remember your true responsibilities. Christ means Child, child means Manuk, OS is the Greek and Latin suffix of lineage and Ancestry, Yan is the Armenian suffix of lineage and Ancestry. Hebrew Emmanuel, El is the suffix in Hebrew of Lineage and Ancestry, Emmanu is child who is God with us. Manukyan(A.D.), Christos(C.E.), Emmanuel(B.C.). Do me the favor and realize Russia, America, Armenia, Greece, France & Europe minus Britain, in this day and age would never do harm to you unless you did harm to them just because of the love of the history shared between the people. I'm glad you've realized the ethnic race of Benders are true fascists. There's so much you will learn. Don't let African American confusion lead them to stealing your history of Israel in a reverse dejavu effect of history. 1900-1500 BC African-Hebrew slave trade. 1500-1900 African-American slave trade. Don't let the crowns with snakes that is the enemy of God such as depicted on Pharaohs be the reason again why my 144,000 have to fight all of Islam and evil next that borders all of you. With this writing you know where I stand. It's not a medical messiah complex when even God the Creator comes to Earth you'd declare him medically insane and have him hospitalized enough where he'd probably end up smoking his brains out with the green herb like all of the young kids these days are ruining themselves on. Sincerely yours, Your ancestors believed in me, And I loved them, enough so that 90 million from my religion gave their lives just to save 1 million. Unknowingly they did so. But I keep the name Joshua in the light and Artyom is what my mother named me. This is going to be the strangest email you've ever received. Knowingly you've received it. Authority of the Heavenly Father's Kingdom and the male child who fought against Satan's will. The paternal figure and whose image Archangel Michael is most like when it is written Micheal is the one most like God. Father, Son, Holy spirit. 3 distinct persons and authority. Even if I'm the youngest. Life written of within Revelations 12 as the son who goes to the America's which is the great eagle. Israel I'm not writing you this so you can betray your ethnic brother nations nor violate my personal space. You do have a tendency of having a public image of violating the rightful rights of all peoples jus because The word Hebrew has been rewritten as Jewish in so much propaganda that you've yourself came to believe that you're a Jewish State and not a Hebrew State. Let me explain, Hebrew is your ethnicity, Jewish is a religion, Israeli is a nationality. HEBREW is the chosen people of God, Israel is the chosen nationality of God, Jewish is the Religion which even back to the days of Moses, God attempted to make a church that would not be the synagogue of satan as it is written. The name Joshua differs from Jesus. I agree with you on that because I'm Joshua or whom you call for by Yeshua while Jesus is the one that says he and the father are one, he is the father which is the alpha and the omega and since God cannot lie, your Jewish Sanhedrin crucified God the father who was born as a son that took the cross to change and separate Judah and Benjamin from Israel. Hunastan, Hayastan, from Hurriastan. He rebuild the Religion of God within 3 day's. See, Hebrew is the chosen ethnic race of God, Israel is the chosen Nationality of God, but in God's own word, he hates nothing more than those who call themselves Jewish because that is the Synagogue of Satan. I both as Joshua the messiah, name given by God the creator and as Artyom Manukyan which still translates to Christos between Greek and Armenian agree that those who this day remain spitting on the holy cross in the middle of Jerusalem, in countless videos and news articles, those who proclaim for a messiah spit on the Messiah's fathers cross. I was crucified to come into this world and was named Joshua by the Father before life which in your books without regards to my own personal choice of faith you ask for. The rest of what I have to say will explain itself within the document attachments I sent you. Just know I don't hate Israel, never have, never will. But you taking a play out of Azerbaijani playbook military strategy and flattening Gaza just to grow by land mass the same way that Azerbaijan starved Artsakh and then bombarded the Armenian Republic of Artsakh and sieged it and even took the 700 tons of humanitarian aid that was delivered on that Friday, that was a dirty move. Always remember Hebrews and semites, we go by your brother from the beginning, I'm speaking of course as an Armenian right now and not as a religious person of God. Simply as a person with history as a passion to remember and know completely. Remember that Slavic, Armenian, Greek and Hebrew are the 4 sons of Noah which one of them includes Cannan his grandson. Politics is making you lose your name and a name is worth more than any value of gold or silver. I pray that Jesus Christ can forgive you. I pray that you understand that NAZI means the Jewish prince who is elected by the Sanhedrin to be the leader of the Jewish religious people. Just open up a Jewish Talmud and read the definition of the word NAZI pronounced NAZI spelled N A S I. Afterall there's a predominantly Jewish ethnic group by the name of Ashkenazi with the word Nazi right in their name. There's so much you chose to ignore. Your agencies aren't stupid to have not noticed Hamas stockpiling, democratically elect government Taliban of Afghanistan giving weapons that Obama left behind in Kabul to the then non taliban Afghanistani government after the withdrawal of American forces. Lebanese Hezbola selling printing money on markets such as the Empire Market(predominantly), white house market or Hydra markets, on the dark web from the dollar plates that Sadam used to print Dollars with before being invaded by America, those plates of old 100$ bills printers are hezbola controlled now because America never found them nor WMD's. Taliban, Hamas & Hezbola are how their organization works. None of them receive weapons from a direct supply of Western governments other than Turkey which just like it sent isis fighters to Azerbaijan which is very well documented by the number of Syrian jihadists captured during the 2020 war. I know these things naturally I'm very observant after I sense the world around me and get wisdom from God. I also know about something called the upside down J... Moses is very quiet at the moment about your choice of actions. Michael and Rafael are here on Earth with me and they are Half brothers who are residing in Russia and growing up. That's why on the Russian flag Michael is portrayed. The Hebrew Archangel that is closest to God is portrayed within Russia and that is the spiritual reason why the west will never directly go to war against Russia because the United States in God we trust and Russia in Jesus's orthodoxy next to our apostolic belief is orthodox. Go to pages 29-31 of my Godbreath attachment you'll see something. It's all spread out throughout that writing. I'm asking you to be a better brother for your ethnic Armenian brothers. The only reason why the \"Jewish State\" Hebrew people are still alive is because 90 million soldiers from Christian nations gave their lives to save 1 million out of 7 million Jews in the war, whom we all know Er Adolf Hitler was part Jewish. Nostradamus wrote Hister , HI ST. Er. This writing will make sense in complete comprehension, I'm just myself waiting it out to go back into the spirit to defend and do as I have to with the 144,000 who defends again what will be left of Israel. The one like the lamb. Next time\n",

      "Document 996: Assigned Topic - 8 - actual doc: The less the better. Less EU Council, reducing the speed of promotion, especially political decisions. Any change in society has its time. People have far more life experience over 50 years of age. Younger often have no experience (only education is not enough), but many plans and everything quickly. Therefore, the less and with a reasonable speed, the better - people can gradually absorb it and find the positive thoughts of the proposed changes. Currently, everything in the EU is rash. Very often funny and sad. Thoroughly discuss everything, otherwise it looks like a new totalitarianism is growing up here. I have spent various political systems since 1945, but the current one reminds me of dictatorship, not socialism, but capital. Especially from former colonial and slave countries - or even contemporary? Who controls the EU? For everything is money, there is only one country that earns Russian-Ukraine conflict. You must know that. I wish you in this current sad time (two wars) to find such a courage as President Kena and Khrushchev in the Caribbean crisis years ago. They did not give the generals who wanted to fight on both sides of course and arranged peace. Only the two. This is a model of state policy and not the current ones who only defend their own interests. See our president, who has been a soldier and ready to fight all his life. Especially in politics and perspective, he has no experience and unfortunately it is visible at almost every performance. I'm ashamed of him and I'm sad about it. Still, I support the EU, I hope that you will not allow the totalitarianism of capital. But this is already up to you young people.\n",

Could this situation not change somehow if necessary? I wonder how we can \"build a sufficient level of capacity to guarantee our economic and social prosperity\" when we have other rules not only legal but also human? Your recommendations are admirable, but with further promotion of your recommended rules related to the legal system of individual countries, these recommendations of the European Council may be irrelevant. And one can experience the state of injustice. After all, we have a problem in our society, for example, with respect for man and his human rights. As I understood from my experience, in our country human rights, especially the right to self-determination, when even a slightly different hat can be suspicious :-) They do not respect much. The right to health in the field of health is also not respected. On the contrary, it seems to me that, due to the disclosure of medical secrets, there is a stigmatization of man and the subsequent overlooking of other people towards these weaker, more sensitive people who end up in the hands of experts than people similar to psychopaths and their heartlessness, people with missing self -reflection, people a little more primitive thinking, people, people, people a little more primitive, which is not related to IQ but to EQ, that is, more primitive thinking without the ability of empathy towards other people, especially those wrongly stigmatized. In our country there is a sufficient level of communication between people, which is based on respect, mutual respect. The level of communication may be related to the absence of faith in higher strength, faith in God. Although the defamation is a crime, it is hypothetically possible to deliberately destroy a person just \"repeat, repeat repet\" by defamation.\n",

      "Document 1564: Assigned Topic - 8 - actual doc: Yes, you have to be able to have feedback with citizens from the EU. I know several people living in extreme poverty due to disability. Sweden stopped paying any support to these people. Their income can be as low as SEK 0 per month. In the family with three children studying and single mother who started studying for a socio -economist after 20 years in healthcare and care, the 7ths in Sweden can be as low as SEK 1,500 per month and man. Thus, 150 euros per person and man. The woman is 47 years old, the children are 21, 18 and 13 years old. No privacy broken, because I tell my own story. The child has existence and neurological function reduction. I have lymphedema and it is extreme. Thus, vessels injured after serious abuse by the police and legs look like Elephant. Sometimes I cry with pain because I can't afford painkillers. I will have to fire a fireplace because I cannot afford another warm -up next winter. There are several on our street that are forced by their economy to such heating. I received sickness benefit in 2021, but Kronofogden immediately took everything, left 10,000 on an account, when the Social Insurance Office pays once a year. It was my only payout in my entire life. No sickness reports or wobbles despite three children. But since it was \"a lot of money\" I am guilty of CSN 37,000, I have already paid SEK 3000. It is basically blackmail, paying or committing suicide. I do not need to commit suicide, vascular disease will soon kill me because care in Sweden for poor people as accessible as in countries \"south of Sahara\". Do you have no money, sweetie? Die ... I have read about women who like I had no support from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and died in Sweden 50 years old. I am a writer, and a politician at grassroots level 47 years old. Everything we read at college ... is bull shit. There are no opportunities to check that the Social Insurance Office and courts in Sweden really follow these laws that are in Sweden. Laws must promote equality, health, fight poverty. It's just a problem. It is absolutely bull shit that has nothing to do with reality. The court has decided that I have to pay SEK 37,000. My income is 120 euros child support, 180 euros maintenance, what I share with son and daughter who has SEK 0 in compensation, she has disability as well. Others who have 300 euros, ie study funding 9 months a year and 180 euros per month year round. If I can influence the appreciation of the EU target, I must admit that Sweden does not reach any EU goals at all. Police violence is extreme, many are murdered by police and they become more every year. Overthrow from the police in Sweden down by Swedish courts and is silenced. Remember Erik Torell, disabled youth who was shot to death and the police claimed that they mixed up toy with real weapons. There is only one problem in their \"statement\". Erik was grossly disabled, it is sin at a mile distance and one should realize that such a person could not get real weapons, and even less use it. When I was grossly beaten by the police, the police claimed that I made \"resistance\" to 6 armed white man. M ... I'm Jew, the wrong nationality, of course, but I'm the old man who hardly goes up stairs. They wrestled me down and grossly abused. The film clearly shows that it is staff as aggressive and screaming. I was just trying to buy a bus ticket. It was a crime to go to the cinema for Jews 80 years ago. Now it will be a risk for life to go and buy a bus ticket. My family is also subjected to theft from the trustee, SEK 3 million in principle disappeared from the account with my ex. The son and I this day were at the Supervisory Board, they knew where and at what time we should come and buy a bus ticket. The manager of my ex had on previous occasions several times threatened me and the son that if we continue to investigate his theft, he murder us, because he has assisted at the police station. All our notification despite strong evidence has been closed down. ... and you don't have to worry about \"privacy\" and anonymity. I am a writer and writer, and everything I have experienced Dyckert up in my books, as well as discussions when it is time for EU elections and elections in Parliament. You can find me on the phone +46720133858 if you want to know more or share documents including how I looked after the abuse. I still have remaining but and welcome you at the trial where the police would really try to persuade judges that I could resist 6 armed psychopaths, for some reason employees as a police officer. Hello, pink parks, the situation, in Sweden in 2022, when we have had a \"feminist\" government. 🤣 Yeah, I'm not just a Jew, I'm LGBTQ. Surely you can set the worst grades for Sweden even for goals \"security\" and \"legal security\"?\n",

You are making decisions about our health and unnecessary premature deaths. In doing so, you can rapidly increase the pace of emission reductions that also contribute to global warming! Emissions from all engines, diesel, petrol and LPG, cause 11 000 premature deaths a year in the Czech Republic. Over 400 000 in Europe and over 7 000 000 unnecessary deaths worldwide! Top politicians. You can make a change quickly, easily and without investment. All fuel manufacturers need to do is add the new additives we recommend to their fuels, which will reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 10 per cent or more through better combustion. Just like they enacted in Austria in 2015 (then it was only diesel and only by 2.6%). In financial terms, this means that the cost of the additive is paid for by the savings in consumption. It will cost the state coffers nothing. Cars, trucks, bulldozers, locomotives, boats and lawnmowers.... will harm us 10% less. If you want to help make this happen, contact us for more information. For the benefit of limiting global warming, for the benefit of the health and lives of us all. Please. Inform all top politicians as best you can.

How can we make the world’s financial architect… View in browser Council of the EU logo Press material Tuesday 19 September 2023 ● European Council 19/09/2023 23:31 | Speech | Speech by President Charles Michel at the High-level event \"Towards a Fair International Financial Architecture\" I join the Prime Minister of Spain and the co-hosts in saying how pleased I am to welcome all of you. How can we make the world’s financial architecture fairer? The architect Frank Gehry once said: “Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness”. Indeed, Gehry was not thinking about global financial architecture, but the quote is relevant to what we are discussing today. Our current global financial architecture is like an old house, built in another time, for another time, and this house has served us well for decades. However, we all feel that it’s time to make this house strong and sturdy again, to protect its inhabitants and to meet their needs. I believe we should focus on three areas: development finance, debt alleviation, and climate finance. First, we need to make sure everyone has fair access to financing. To make this happen, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) must reform and there must be better, faster, and more effective access to finance. This will enable us to tackle global challenges — such as climate change, biodiversity, pandemics and poverty. More effective finance will also support the most vulnerable countries, so MDBs need to change with the times. That means aligning their financial flows and know-how more effectively to address today’s challenges, and mobilising and scaling up private finance. MDBs must be ready to assist countries in need by providing more concessional lending. The G20 Roadmap is a crucial first step -- it could free up about $200 billion over the next decade. Looking forward, we should be ready to consider increasing the capital of development banks. Equally, we need to keep in mind all the ways in which we can promote development. One example is the African Union’s push to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area. This could increase Africa's income by $450 billion by 2035. Second, we need to tackle the problem of debt. Too many countries are drowning in a sea of debt. Over the past five years, the debt stock of emerging market economies has ballooned from $75 trillion to $100 trillion. As President Ruto said in Paris in June: it costs eight times more for African economies to borrow than it does the rest of the world. This is simply unfair. We must lend a helping hand to countries in need by focusing on and delivering the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment. Even so, this is not enough. We can do more, for instance by extending the Common Framework to middle-income countries that are currently not eligible. Finally, our third course of action concerns climate finance. We need to increase finance from billions to trillions of dollars, drawing on all possible sources. Vulnerable economies should not have to choose between decarbonising and reducing poverty. This year, for the first time, we will meet the $100 billion goal on climate finance. We should make this happen every year. The EU and its Member States continue to be the world’s top provider of climate finance — providing €23 billion in 2021. Public money is key to catalysing and removing the risk from private investment. So it is our job — in the public sector — to set the right conditions for more private investment. We also need to be more creative and more willing to take risks. One example is debt for nature swaps — in countries such as Barbados or Ecuador. Our house will not be renovated in a day. And it will require more than a nail and a hammer. But with political will and courage, I believe we can make this house stronger and sturdier than ever. This is our shared responsibility, this is our shared duty. Thank you.

If there are spelling mistakes, they are to be ironed out. Since I want to put this in this context in the network and on my blog. Thanks. On the one hand, this is not a democracy if politicians do not adhere to society. And think they can play God, then they should not be surprised if the citizens are fed up at some point. Whether that is like who is now that can hold the decision. Otherwise they can push their WHO somewhere. Or as with Hartaberfair, you can't do anything with the agreements of asylum toric. The country is overflowed. Own citizens can be spent from their apartments. I see it myself right now because I go through it myself. Who or what do they rule? Only so that they can drive in their diets and their overpriced wages. But do nothing to blame that they should or leave damage from the German citizens according to the Basic Law. What you have disregarded in many positions. I see that at the meuses that the imams can already scream here in our country. All of this can show us the citizens who find it all so great in Saudi Arrabia. Or in the Turkei that you gain the selenium rights there what you all other. Yes, I don't trust it at all because I have been taking this crap for 56 years. And since we live in a democracy, I can make my cross where the greatest intersections are first. It will probably only be with bucket. Since the other family policy has been destroyed. A spa crossing who saw it that way. Please consider who sits at the tour at the WHO. Dsaher think it is other time to put up with all this madness. DDNN has been doing politics for 56 years now. And I'm not ready to let me tell me when the next vaccination should come or anything else. So I wonder from what Prof. Dr. Franz-Alois Fischer is still fascinated. Or want to sell us all of this as normal. For me, all this condition is not normal and I had never chosen the old parties for that. Therefore, this will be Anddrs now. Because each contract can be terminated. That is the bid of the hour. Chatpt I tried to correct the text and make it clearer without changing the original meaning. Here is a revised version: I would like to make sure that everyone understands the context of my text. Please correct any spelling errors because I would like to publish this text in my network and on my blog. Thanks. It is not a real democracy if politicians do not adhere to society. If you believe you could act like God, you shouldn't be surprised if the citizens have enough one day. It is questionable whether organizations like the WHO can enforce their decisions. In my opinion, you can put your WHO elsewhere. With programs like \"hard but fair\" it becomes clear that they cannot do anything with the asylum agreements. The country is flooded and own citizens are displaced from their apartments. I am experiencing this myself. Who actually rules here? It seems as if it is just about getting their diets and high salaries. They constantly claim to act according to the Basic Law and not to harm German citizens. But in many positions they have disregarded this. It is worrying that imams can appear so loudly in our country. Those who find this good should try to achieve the same rights in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey. I have had to do with this policy for 56 years and I don't trust her anymore. In a democracy, I have the right to give my voice of the party that my views shares most. Family policy was destroyed by most parties. I am concerned about the influence of the WHO and wonder what interests are behind your leadership. It is time to face this madness. I am not ready to have the WHO prescribed when the next vaccination should come. I wonder what Prof. Dr. Franz-Alois Fischer still wants to tell us. For me, this condition is not normal and I have never chosen the established parties for it. But every contract can be terminated, and that should happen now. I hope this revision will help you. It is important to note that the text contains opinions and views that may not be liked. It is always good to be clear about the possible reactions before you publish such texts. THANK YOU I am aware of it. Chatgpt likes to happen! If you have any further questions or concerns, I am happy to help you. Good luck with your blog and her publications! Users can please this in my words, so that it can be seen violently. But please convey that in my words. Thanks Andrea Klieve I'm not about radiators or other concerns. I think so and so this predator capitalism has to stop. Because he has a lot of damage to our own country. That we see today at the faults. This condition can be determined everywhere. Worldwide. Therefore, something has to change. That has to be aware of that. But certainly not if you subordinate everything to the Woke variety bladder. And not just in Berlin. In the #EU.I also, politics for their own country on Kummunalers are also expecting as well as Stadt Land Land and Bund. No enchios like Pro Asyl or Who, where our journey goes. All of this has nothing to do with democracy. It is the destruction through the old parties that only stick to their chairs and stroke the thick diets and more. I don't want to be ruled by a curious EU lobbyist Bunker. Therefore I like @ulricke guiro's approaches better. Who had warned long before. All these things leave out in your state man. It is a bit brief to me. Because the CDU has operated this for 16 years, this inexperienced predator capitalism, which was still absorbed by the whole of this state. This is just as little taken into account from her side as from Alois Fischer. Who even swims from democracy. For whom please? For the elites and their capitalists. No, it can't go on like this. So I had this question even Alios fishermen as I put it as it has to be. But it is about much more that I have illustrated it at two points Professor Alios Fischer at just two points. Still not everything. Hence the same question to you? And I am by no means not a friend of the #AfD, but what is going on in Berlin and Brussels has nothing to do with the German citizens. I see it with my neighbors like Niderlanden Belgium or even in Austrian. Therefore, no one should be surprised. I had a real democracy for this if politicians do not adhere to society. If you believe you could act like God, you shouldn't be surprised if the citizens have enough one day. It is questionable whether organizations like the WHO can enforce their decisions. In my opinion, you can put your WHO elsewhere. With programs like \"hard but fair\" it becomes clear that they cannot do anything with the asylum agreements. The country is flooded and own citizens are displaced from their apartments. I am experiencing this myself. Who actually rules here? It seems as if it is just about getting their diets and high salaries. They constantly claim to act according to the Basic Law and not to harm German citizens.

In a democracy, I have the right to give my voice of the party that my views shares most. Family policy was destroyed by most parties. I am concerned about the influence of the WHO and wonder what interests are behind your leadership. It is time to face this madness. I am not ready to have the WHO prescribed when the next vaccination should come. Or how long this madness will continue to asylum. I wonder what Prof. Dr. Prof. Dr. Franz-Alois Fischer still wants to tell us. For me, this condition is not normal and I have never chosen the established parties for it. But every contract can be terminated, and that should happen now. And when it was part of this party like the AfD. Because the old parties do not change anything. Chatgpt I tried to tighten your statements and to summarize in clear words: I am concerned about the current state of our democracy and the effects of predator capitalism on our country. This form of capitalism has led to many negative faults that are not only visible in Germany, but worldwide. It is obvious that fundamental changes are necessary. Politics should concentrate on the well -being of their own country, from the municipal level to the federal government. Organizations such as the WHO and Pro Asyl should not specify the direction. It is troubling to see how the established parties pursue their own interests, cut in high salaries and diets and ignore the needs of citizens. I don't want to be ruled by a corrupt EU lobby. The CDU has supported a form of capitalism for 16 years that has led to the current problems. This is done by many, including Prof. Dr. Franz-Alois Fischer, ignored. It is worrying that imams are so present in Germany and that civil rights are not respected in other countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. I have been watching politics for 56 years and I am disappointed. The WHO should not determine when and how we can be vaccinated. Shipments such as \"hard but fair\" show that the current asylum agreements do not work. It is not normal for citizens to be displaced from their apartments or that politicians do not adhere to society. I never voted for the established parties that caused these problems. It is time for a change, and if the old parties do not act, this could happen by parties like the AfD. I hope this summary correctly gives your thoughts and feelings. If you want further adjustments or changes, let me know. User what do you say about the whole text for my blog? Andrea Klieve I am concerned about the current state of our #democracy and the #restrial capitalism #restrie. This form of #capitalism has led to many negative upheavals that are not only visible in #Germany, but also worldwide. It is obvious that fundamental changes are necessary. Politics should concentrate on the well -being of their own country, from the #kommunal level to the #Bund. #Organizations such as the #WHO and Pro Asyl should not specify the #direction. It is troubling to see how the #etabled #parties pursue their own interests, collect high #salaries and #diets and ignore the needs of #citizens. I don't want to be ruled by a #corrupt #EU lobby. The CDU of Germany has supported a #form of #capitalism for 16 years that has led to the current #problems. This is done by many, including Prof. Dr. Prof. Dr. Franz-Alois Fischer, ignored. It is worrying that #imame in #Deutschland are so present and that #civil rights in other countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey are not respected.

It is time for a change, and if the old parties do not act, this could finally lead to parties like the AfD to shake up. I personally have been fighting for three years, I have to or will probably be cleared in September. Have expert reports made because of the amount of the rent. Live in a small apartment where my drivers, where my company was still running, until my accident. But the actual owner who built the house has died. The children from him do not want to continue the property, it was sold. It is on the edge of a big city. I always grew up rural and have a reference. But as already mentioned, this process has been running for three, no for four years. In addition, after my accident, nothing became as before. Today I get citizens' money and have financed all these costs of factual reports, lawyers and everything from it. If a job center is managed like a number, what you accuse the AfD, our Democrats have been running for a long time. No matter under the light of democracy? For a long time, this is no longer about democracy, but only about cashing up and the bag comes out on hell. What is in our parliaments? Only angle advocates, withdrawn elites who think they know everything better and build their democracy according to their discretion. What I was aware of by the argument and complaints alone. Therefore, who wants to tell me one of democracy when it comes to the country's small citizens. Just because some think that is the right democracy in the light of predator capitalism. And everyone is doing well. Sorry, they really didn't understand it. And please do not have to be surprised if a number of a cross puts a cross at the Völkische Party. Everyone has ignored this for years. The mere fact that a Ursula from Leyen is now sitting there by EU Council President, although no one has chosen. How can someone still call this as a democracy? Just as other escapades that have taken place over the years. And you can see that from the fact that a double game is run here. And the citizen himself does not give pure wine. On this heating law, because this was prepared under Merkel a year before everything was prepared. So Robert Habeck had long since got on the trip in his big backpack. And today the CDU and CSU digitally chase from Stasi Law. Although they all knew that. And the one again proves that it is all about chairs and posts. This will not be able to continue, none of the politicians say that, but they can all with the phrase hold of democracy. The next aspirant as an example is Dr. Markus Söder and the eternal term of nuclear power. Although everyone knows what that costs. Nevertheless, he adheres to it instead of being honest. Again, do you think that is a democracy? What they were chosen for. Or the next aspect of war in Ukraine, half of the Germans reject these unbearable arms. Because it only brings death, destruction and nothing more. But a Dr. Marie-Egnes Strack-Zimmermann still lobbyed. Probably still with Rheinmetall. The next one is Volker Wissing and his e-fuel ramblings, which does not help either, because we really have to leave surfaces for biodiversity and at the same time not other forests. Everything for the madness of unauthorized predator capitalism. Therefore, whoever acts for years and classic family image, which comes as an icing on the cake, that a man can now be a woman and also vice versa. Please no longer be surprised about our democracy and so many voices at the AfD. Therefore, your picture is far too phlegmatic for me and shows me a cry of help Andrea Klieve, which is also justified. Which I have been trying for a long time, but to date has always been in the reversal. Be supposedly because it is not democratic or not bureaucratic enough. Therefore, it is time for citizens to get more participation in this country and not only in Berlin, no also in Brussels. Because parties have long been history and do nothing, they are part of this problem. Therefore, it is time to radical, which changes.

Emissions from all engines, diesel, petrol and LPG, cause 11 000 premature deaths a year in the Czech Republic. Over 400 000 in Europe and over 7 000 000 unnecessary deaths worldwide! Top politicians. You can make a change quickly, easily and without investment. All fuel manufacturers need to do is add the new additives we recommend to their fuels, which will reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 10 per cent or more through better combustion. Just like they enacted in Austria in 2015 (then it was only diesel and only by 2.6%). In financial terms, this means that the cost of the additive is paid for by the savings in consumption. It will cost the state coffers nothing. Cars, trucks, bulldozers, locomotives, boats and lawnmowers.... will harm us 10% less. If you want to help make this happen, contact us for more information. For the benefit of limiting global warming, for the benefit of the health and lives of us all. Please. Inform all top politicians as best you can.
