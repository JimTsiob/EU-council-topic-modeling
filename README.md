# EU-council-topic-modeling
Topic modeling for a survey answer dataset. Topics were created using the Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm.

Dataset was extracted from a survey of the EU council regarding their website.
Questions were the following: 
1. Do you have any other comments or suggestions for how we could improve the Council website?
2. What changes would you like to see in order to come back?
3. In what way would machine translation impact the way you use the Council website?
